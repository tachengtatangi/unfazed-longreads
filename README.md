# Unfazed-longreads：phasing tool for *de novo* SNVs（third-sequecing）

Unfazed-longreads identifies the parent of origin for *de novo* variants from the third sequencing bam file, accepting input from a bed file of variant information. Unfazed-longreads works for SNVs.We sincerely thank Jonathan R Belyeu for his second-generation sequencing phasing software unfazed, which allowed us to produce this triple sequencing targeting software, see (and cite) his paper at https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/37/24/4860/6306405.
